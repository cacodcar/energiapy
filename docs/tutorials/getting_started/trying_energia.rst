Try without Installation
=========================

To try Energia without installation, use the little rocket icon (ðŸš€) on the upper right
corner of a notebook tutorial or example. 

The options are:

- `Thebe Live Code <https://teachbooks.io/manual/examples/live_code.html#>`_: Opens an interactive coding environment directly in your browser.
  You can run and modify code snippets right here on the documentation site.

- `Launch in Binder <https://mybinder.org/>`_: Launches a temporary online environment with Energia installed.
  Note that any files you create or modify will be lost when you close the session.

- `Launch in Google Colab <https://colab.google/>`_: Opens a Google Colab notebook *without* Energia installed.
  Uncomment and run the first line (!pip install energiapy) before running any code cells.

.. note::

    Thebe and Binder are not monetized, and may take some time to start up depending on server engagement.
    Install Energia locally if possible to avoid overloading these services.
